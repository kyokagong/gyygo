# gyygo
an implement of alphago, for learning tensorflow

The main go and mcts code came from https://github.com/pycharming/AlphaGo

I just replace the deep net by tensorflow. So, in the near future, I can change what model what I need

# Version 0.1 Function

2, no winner judgement of the webwiste

# Future

Last, the main go program is on localhost:8000
